        <p>Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch.

            For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on speech based writing systems.The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille).
            <br>

            There is a growing body of evidence which illustrates the importance of reading for pleasure for both educational purposes as well as personal development.Photo: Reading a newspaper in Catania, Sicily.
